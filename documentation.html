                    What is 3GS?
                </h3>

                3GS is a 3D graphics library that is used to create interactive and immersive 3D graphics
                applications.
                It is an open-source software library that is widely used in the fields of computer graphics,
                simulation, and gaming. 3GS is written in JavaScript and is based on the WebGL API, which is a
                graphics
                rendering technology that is built into modern web browsers.

                    Visualization of the Solar System using 3GS:
                </h3>

                The visualization of the Solar System using 3GS involves creating a 3D model of the Solar System,
                which
                can be viewed from any angle and zoom level. The model is based on accurate scientific data about
                the
                size, shape, and position of the planets, moons, and other celestial bodies in the Solar System.

                </p>

                <p>
                <h3>
                    We created the Solar System visualization model by following these steps:
                </h3>
                <h4>
                    Creating a 3D model of the Sun:
                </h4>

                The Sun is the center of the Solar System, and therefore, it is the
                starting point of the 3D model. A simple sphere was used to represent the Sun, and its size can be
                adjusted based on its actual size.

                <h4>

                    Adding the planets:
                </h4>

                The planets were added to the 3D model in their correct positions relative to the Sun. The size of each
                planet were adjusted based on its actual size, and its texture was mapped onto its surface using a
                high-resolution image.

                <h4>

                    Add the moons:
                </h4>
                Many of the planets in the Solar System have one or more moons, which was added to the 3D model in their
                correct positions relative to their parent planet. The size of each moon was adjusted based on its
                actual size, and its texture was mapped onto its surface using a high-resolution image.

                <h4>

                    Adding the asteroids and comets:
                </h4>
                The Solar System also contains many asteroids and comets, which was added to the 3D model in their
                correct positions relative to the Sun. The size of each asteroid or comet was adjusted based on its
                actual size, and its texture was mapped onto its surface using a high-resolution image.

                <h4>
                    Adding the orbits:
                </h4>
                Finally, the orbits of the planets, moons, asteroids, and comets were added to the 3D model. The orbits
                were represented as elliptical paths around the Sun, and their size and shape were adjusted based on
                their actual orbits.
                </p>


                <p>
                <h3>
                    Conclusion:
                </h3>
                In conclusion, the visualization of the Solar System using 3GS is an effective way to create
                immersive
                and interactive 3D graphics applications. The accurate scientific data about the Solar System can be
                used to create a 3D model that can be viewed from any angle and zoom level. This type of
                visualization
                can be used for educational purposes, scientific research, and even entertainment. With the help of
                3GS,
                the Solar System can be brought to life in a way that was never before possible.

            <h1>Some 3D Graphics Techniques used: </h1>
            <div class="describe">
                <h3>Scene: </h3>
                <p>
                    In Three.js, a scene is an object that represents a 3D environment where you can add objects,
                    lights, cameras, and other elements to create a visual experience.
                    A scene in Three.js is created using the THREE.Scene() constructor, and it serves as the container
                    for all the 3D objects that will be rendered. Once you have a scene object, you can add other
                    objects to it using the add() method, such as meshes, lights, and cameras.
                    The scene also holds information about the background color, fog, and other global settings that
                    affect the rendering of the objects in the scene. Additionally, the scene provides a space for the
                    renderer to draw the objects in, and it manages the transformation of the objects based on the
                    camera's view and position.
                </p>

                <h3>Camera: </h3>
                <p>
                    In Three.js, a camera is an object that defines the perspective or view of the 3D scene. It
                    determines what part of the scene is visible to the user, and how the objects in the scene are
                    projected onto the 2D screen.

                    There are several types of cameras in Three.js, including THREE.PerspectiveCamera,
                    THREE.OrthographicCamera, and THREE.CubeCamera. The most commonly used camera is the
                    PerspectiveCamera, which mimics the way the human eye perceives the world, by using a field of view,
                    aspect ratio, and near and far clipping planes.

                    A camera in Three.js has various properties that can be set to control the view of the scene. Some
                    of these properties include:

                    position: The position of the camera in 3D space.
                    lookAt: The point in 3D space the camera is pointed towards.
                    fov: The field of view of the camera.
                    aspect: The aspect ratio of the camera's view.
                    near and far: The near and far clipping planes of the camera.
                </p>

                <h3>Mesh: </h3>
                <p>
                    In Three.js, a mesh is a three-dimensional object that is created by combining a geometry, which
                    defines the shape of the object, and a material, which defines how the object appears when rendered.

                    The geometry of a mesh is defined by its vertices, or points in 3D space, and its faces, or the
                    triangular surfaces that connect those vertices. The material of a mesh determines its color,
                    texture, and other visual properties.

                    Meshes can be used to represent a wide variety of 3D objects, such as characters, buildings, or
                    landscapes. They can also be animated and manipulated in various ways, such as by changing their
                    position, rotation, or scale.

                    In Three.js, there are many different types of meshes available, including BoxGeometry,
                    SphereGeometry, CylinderGeometry, and PlaneGeometry, among others. These meshes can be combined and
                    customized to create complex 3D scenes and animations.
                </p>

                <h3>Geometry: </h3>
                <p>
                    In Three.js, a geometry is an object that defines the shape of a three-dimensional object. It is a
                    collection of vertices (points in 3D space) and faces (triangular surfaces) that make up the surface
                    of an object.

                    A geometry can be created using a variety of methods, such as by defining the vertices and faces
                    manually, or by using built-in functions that generate common shapes like cubes, spheres, or
                    cylinders. Once a geometry is defined, it can be used to create a mesh, which is the combination of
                    the geometry and a material that determines how the object looks when rendered.

                    Geometries can be customized in various ways, such as by adding texture coordinates, normals
                    (vectors that define the direction a surface is facing), or color information to each vertex. This
                    allows for more complex and realistic 3D objects to be created.

                    In Three.js, there are many different types of geometries available, each suited for different
                    purposes. Some common types of geometries include BoxGeometry, SphereGeometry, CylinderGeometry,
                    PlaneGeometry, and TorusGeometry, among others. These geometries can be combined and customized to
                    create complex 3D scenes and animations.

                <h3>Lighting Model: </h3>
                <p>

                    In Three.js, a lighting model is a set of rules and algorithms that define how light interacts with
                    a 3D object. Three.js provides several lighting models, including:

                <h4>
                    1.AmbientLight:
                </h4>
                This lighting model provides a general illumination to a scene. It doesn't cast shadows or create
                highlights, but it helps to brighten up the objects in a scene.

                <h4>
                    2.DirectionalLight:
                </h4> This lighting model simulates sunlight by casting light in a specific direction. It can cast
                shadows and create highlights on objects in a scene.

                <h4>

                    PointLight:
                </h4>
                This lighting model simulates a light bulb by casting light in all directions from a single point. It
                can also cast shadows and create highlights on objects in a scene.

                <h4>

                    SpotLight:
                </h4>
                This lighting model simulates a spotlight by casting a cone of light in a specific direction. It can
                cast shadows and create highlights on objects in a scene.
                <br />
                These lighting models can be combined and adjusted to create the desired lighting effects for a 3D
                scene. Three.js also supports various materials, textures, and shaders that can be used to further
                enhance the lighting effects in a scene.
